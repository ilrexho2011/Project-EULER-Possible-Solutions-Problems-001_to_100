Quadratic primes

Problem 27
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:


It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 
. However, when 
 is divisible by 41, and certainly when 
 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula 
 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values . The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Find the product of the coefficients, 
a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of starting with n=0.
