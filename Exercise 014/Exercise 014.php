/**
 * Problem: The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
 *
 * n → n/2 (n is even)
 * n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
 *
 * Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
 *
 * 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
 * It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains
 * 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought
 * that all starting numbers finish at 1.
 *
 * Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
 *
 * Solution: Starting with 2 and working up towards 1,000,000, create each chain,
 * stopping where a previous chain has already been done.  So...  If we've already
 * created chains starting with 2 and 8, the array looks like (split links by "."):
 * 2 => ".1"
 * 8 => ".4.2.1"
 * Then, when we get to 10, we process the chain, checking for 5 to be already done and
 * it's not, so we move on and get to 16 which isn't done, so we move on and check for 8
 * and find a chain, at which point we stop processing and add 8's chain to the end.
 *
 * We don't stop until we try all 1,000,000 numbers.
