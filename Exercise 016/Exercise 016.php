 * Problem: 2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.
 *
 * What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?
 *
 * Solution: The trick is the scientific notation.  First, we generate the 2^1000
 * number.  Then I'll strip all the trailing zero digits since we don't need them.
 * Finally, sum the rest of the numbers.
