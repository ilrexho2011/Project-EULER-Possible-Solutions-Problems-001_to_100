/**
 * Problem: Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
 * If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable
 * numbers.
 *
 * For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284.
 * The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
 *
 * Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
 *
 * Solution: For each number 2 to 10000, check if it is amicable with the sum of its factors.  Too brute force.
 * Must refactor.
